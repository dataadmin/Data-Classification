			<center><p><i>This is a guide to the process of categorizing university data by the level of risk to 
				ensure that its confidentiality, integrity and appropriate availability are not compromised in the running of 
				university business. This process considers that data is protected and in compliance with both government regulations 
				and institutional policies from the time it is created until it is disposed. The four center tabs with lock 
				icons below provide definitions and examples of data at each risk level as indicated by the number of locks.
				The last tab on the right presents guidelines on how to safeguard data through its lifecycle.
